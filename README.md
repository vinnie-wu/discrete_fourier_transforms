# Discrete Fourier Transform - Demonstration in Code

#### Background
The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) is discussed frequently in undergraduate controls & signals courses. The underlying idea is that signals in one domain (time) may be easier to analyze in another domain (frequency), so it can be further manipulated and utilized in technologies. The code demonstrated here is used to provide the users with an intuitive understanding of how the DFT actually works, and how it can be directly implemented in applications such as speeding up the processing time of a large dataset analysis, or video/image processing.
#### Code
There are two primary projects that I have developed to demonstrate this. Both are developed in undergraduate UBC courses, respectively: CPSC 259 and ELEC 221. Credits for the projects motivation are given to the course instructors teaching me at that time: Dr. Geoffrey Tien, Dr. Lutz Lampe.
